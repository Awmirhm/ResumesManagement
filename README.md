# *This project is a resume management project made with `iterator` and `three-layer architecture`.*

## The first part is for sending resume and the second part is for application admin.

### _In the resume section, the user must enter his name, surname, date of birth, gender, skills, email and photo._

### _In the admin section, only application admins have access to this section, they can see the submitted resumes and their profiles._

## _The reason for using `iterator` in this project was that there may be millions of records of forms stored in the database, we cannot get all these records from the database at the same time and display them in the program, that's why `iterator` is used. In this way, first we show each data, then if we want to show the next data and so on._
